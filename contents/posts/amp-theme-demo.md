# Amp Theme Demo

This article uses the **Amp report** style theme. The goal is to feel like a concise product or model-change report, with a slightly editorial tone.

## Background

- The team iterated on several model configurations.
- User feedback highlighted stability and clarity issues.
- Cost and latency were carefully measured.

> The main question: *can we upgrade quality without silently increasing cost?*

## Data Snapshot

Some quick, informal numbers:

- Accuracy improvement: **+4.2%** on internal evals
- Average latency: **-18%** per long thread
- Review overhead: **-30%** fewer manual corrections

Inline math also works here: $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$.

And a block formula for reference:

$$
\mathrm{Cost}_{\text{effective}} = \frac{\text{token
overall}}{\text{useful\_answers}}
$$

## Takeaways

1. The new configuration feels more stable for long dialogues.
2. Writers can focus on story and structure instead of chasing tool quirks.
3. The visual style is warm and slightly print-inspired, matching the Amp report aesthetic.
