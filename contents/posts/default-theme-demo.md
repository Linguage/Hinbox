# Default Theme Demo

This post demonstrates the **default** Markdown reading theme.

It is designed to look like a clean, classic blog article that matches the overall Gmail-style layout.

## Sections and Lists

Here is a simple bullet list:

- First idea: keep the layout readable
- Second idea: avoid overly strong decorations
- Third idea: let the *content* speak

> "Good typography should disappear behind the text itself."

## Inline Code and Blocks

You can highlight inline code like `console.log("hello")` inside a sentence.

```ts
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Hinbox"));
```

## A Tiny Formula

Inline math like $E = mc^2$ should be rendered inside the text.

A display equation:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$

That is all for the **default** theme demo.
